<br><b>RULES AND WARNINGS</b>
<br>===================
<br>The following applies to all commission types:
<br>
<br>- I PREFER communicating via Discord, but commissions are also accepted through Furaffinity/Inkbunny notes and other mediums of chat if you know me there. I only speak English. With Discord i can easily send previews and questions, and the communication delay is less aswell.
<br>- I WILL be messaging you and sending you previews and asking questions about your commission. Try to answer promptly so i can continue working on it, kaythxbyeluvyou.
<br>- WIP previews cannot be requested at Coloring Phase and later, unless i already got paid (how dare you! :0).
<br>- Im fine with doing any post payment changes you want, though there are limits to what i can do at that point with the picture being essentially finished.
<br>
<br>- By commissioning, you give me permission to upload the requested image including those of your original character, whether or not you were capable of payment upon its completion.
<br>- Make sure you are content with the current quality of my recent works before commissioning.
<br>- Commissions are not necessarily completed in the order they were added. Because i might work on multiple at once. In fact, ones that seem quicker to finish tend to get a little more priority.
<br>- I do not recommend giving me total, complete artistic freedom on your image. Ill do weird things to your character, guaranteed.
<br>- Unless it is a Character Sheet, i am NOT designing your character. A minimum degree of designing from me should be required for your character. Please have a character sheet or reference pictures ready.
<br>- Only one commission per individual at a time.
<br>
<br>- USD Only. If not USD, use one of the listed payment methods or furaffinity shinies. I prefer if im paid when im finished, though ill accept payment up front if waiting is inconvenient for you, particularly if i have no doubts it will be completed.
<br>- All commissions have an UP FRONT cost, which is a percentage of the commission's total to be paid before acceptance, the rest is expected upon picture completion. This UP FRONT cost is only refundable while the picture is in sketch phase AND I am not the canceller.
<br>- - - - Commissions up to $150 in value: 50% up front
<br>- - - - Commissions over $150 in value: 30% up front
<br>- - - - Commissions i cancel myself have the up front cost refunded, of course.
<br>- - - - Commissions cancelled by you before sketch phase have the up front cost refunded.
<br>- - - - Commissions cancelled by you will not be given. They are archived and may be continued at a later date for a $50 continue fee, if the archive is still intact.
<br>- - - - Commissions up to $150 in value that are over 35 days old that are canceled have their up front cost refunded, regardless of phase.
<br>- - - - Commissions over $150 in value that are over 60 days old that are canceled have their up front cost refunded, regardless of phase.
<br>- - - - Processing fees levied by the utilized platform, if there are any, will not be included in the refund. That's out of my control. I refund what i originally received.
<br>- I can be slow sometimes. Theres all sorts of interference that can occur. If i find i cannot complete your commission, i'll cancel.
<br>- After completion, you have 2 weeks (14 days) to send payment. If the deadline is not met, you'll be banned from commissions for 150 days, be more restricted upon after that expires and trust with you may be hindered for future commissions. Let me know if your financial situation took a drastic turn for the worst, so we can talk.
<br>- Image will be given to you after payment is received.
<br>
<br>- No image i create will be hidden away as private. I am free to upload them. You can request yourself to be anonymous.
<br>- You may request the workfolder of your commission when its finished if you'd like. i will send it to you somehow. Probably via google drive. If the commission is advanced enough, the workfolder can get to gigabytes in size due to my snapshot procedure. (images 001-156 and 176-241 don't have or have lost their workfolders)

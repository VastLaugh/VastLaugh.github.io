<br><b>RULES AND WARNINGS</b>
<br>===================
<br>The following applies to all commission types:
<br>
<br>- I PREFER communicating via Discord, but commissions are also accepted through Furaffinity/Inkbunny notes and other mediums of chat if you know me there. I only speak English.
<br>With Discord i can easily send previews and questions, and the communication delay is less aswell.
<br>
<br>- I WILL be messaging you and sending you previews and asking questions about your commission. Try to answer promptly so i can continue working on it, kaythxbyeluvyou.
<br>- WIP previews cannot be requested at Coloring Phase and later, unless i already got paid (how dare you! :0).
<br>- Im fine with doing any post payment changes you want, though there are limits to what i can do at that point with the picture being essentially finished.
<br>
<br>- By commissioning, you give me permission to upload the requested image including those of your original character, whether or not you were capable of payment upon its completion.
<br>- Make sure you are content with the current quality of my recent works before commissioning.
<br>- Commissions are not necessarily completed in the order they were added. Because i might work on multiple at once. In fact, ones that seem quicker to finish tend to get a little more priority.
<br>- I do not recommend giving me total, complete artistic freedom on your image. Ill do weird things to your character, guaranteed.
<br>- Unless it is a Character Sheet, i am NOT designing your character. A minimum degree of designing from me should be required for your character. Please have a character sheet or reference pictures ready.
<br>- Only one commission per individual at a time.
<br>
<br>- USD Only. If not USD, use one of the listed payment methods or furaffinity shinies. I prefer if im paid when im finished, though ill accept payment up front if waiting is inconvenient for you, particularly if i have no doubts it will be completed.
<br>- Since payment will not be received until completion, Commissioning me does not guarantee the completion of the commission or an ETA. I can be slow sometimes. Untreated adhd and life interruptions do that, and performance suffers if i force myself when im not feeling it. If i can't bring myself to do it, i'll cancel.
<br>- After completion, you have 2 weeks (14 days) to send payment. If the deadline is not met, you'll be banned from commissions for 150 days, be more restricted upon after that expires and trust with you may be hindered for future commissions. Let me know if your financial situation took a drastic turn for the worst, so we can talk.
<br>- Image will be given to you after payment is received.
<br>
<br>- No image i create will be hidden away as private. I am free to upload them. You can request yourself to be anonymous.
<br>- You may request the workfolder of your commission when its finished if you'd like. i will send it to you somehow. Probably via google drive. If the commission is advanced enough, the workfolder can get to gigabytes in size due to my snapshot procedure. (images 001-156 and 176-241 don't have or have lost their workfolders)
